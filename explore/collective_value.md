Imagine if this game could be configured to tap into collective higher value as "winning"?

# Collective Value Co-Discovery and Creation Specification

## Core Concepts

1. **Value as Emergent Property**: Values emerge from interactions between agents, not predetermined by the simulation designer.

2. **Collective Discovery**: Agents learn to recognize patterns and signals that indicate value alignment with others.

3. **Co-Creation**: Agents must collaborate to create higher-order values that no single agent could discover alone.

4. **Value Measurement**: The system measures collective value through observable behaviors and emergent patterns.

## Simulation Environment

### Agents
- Multiple agents with different initial capabilities and perspectives
- Each agent has:
  - Perception: Limited field of view of environment and other agents
  - Memory: History of interactions and value signals
  - Communication: Ability to send/receive signals to other agents
  - Action space: Movement, resource manipulation, signal production

### Environment
- Grid-based world with:
  - Resources: Basic elements that can be gathered and combined
  - Obstacles: Barriers requiring cooperation to overcome
  - Markers: Can be placed to communicate or record information
  - Value Nodes: Special locations that activate when collective values emerge

### Interaction Mechanisms
- Resource sharing: Agents can transfer resources to others
- Signal exchange: Communication of internal states or intentions
- Collaborative building: Multiple agents required for certain structures
- Perspective sharing: Agents can temporarily perceive through others' viewpoints

## Value System Design

### Value Signal Types
1. **Individual Value**: Personal utility satisfaction
2. **Pairwise Value**: Emergent from two-agent interactions
3. **Group Value**: Requires coordination of 3+ agents
4. **Collective Value**: System-wide patterns of behavior and resource organization

### Value Emergence Conditions
- **Symmetry**: Balanced exchange of resources between agents
- **Novelty**: Discovery of new combinations or patterns
- **Stability**: Maintenance of beneficial arrangements over time
- **Complexity**: Creation of intricate, nested collaborative structures
- **Adaptation**: Successful responses to environmental changes

### Value Recognition Mechanisms
- Pattern detection algorithms identify emergent value signals
- Network analysis measures integration of agent collaboration
- Entropy reduction metrics track information organization
- Diversity and inclusion indicators for heterogeneous agent participation

## Learning Framework

### Agent Learning
- Reinforcement learning from direct value signals
- Meta-learning to discover value patterns
- Social learning through observation of successful agents

### Collective Learning
- Shared knowledge repositories accessible to all agents
- Cultural evolution mechanisms for value transmission
- Information markets for trading valuable insights
- Norm establishment through repeated interactions

## Simulation Scenarios

1. **Resource Allocation Challenge**: Agents must distribute limited resources to maximize collective wellbeing

2. **Knowledge Assembly**: Fragments of information must be combined to create complete understanding

3. **Adaptive Response**: Environmental threats require coordinated response strategies

4. **Innovation Task**: Novel solutions emerge through diverse agent collaboration

5. **Value Alignment**: Agents with different initial value functions converge on shared higher values

## MeTTa Implementation Considerations

- Define agent perception, decision-making, and action components
- Create environmental dynamics with emergent properties
- Implement value detection and measurement systems
- Design learning mechanisms for individual and collective adaptation
- Build visualization tools to observe value emergence
- Create metrics for measuring success in collective value creation

## Expected Emergent Phenomena

- Spontaneous division of labor
- Development of communication protocols
- Emergence of fairness norms
- Formation of specialized agent groups
- Discovery of unexpected cooperative solutions
- Evolution of altruistic behaviors
- Creation of shared symbolic representations

## Expanded Value Semantics

### Multi-dimensional Value Framework
- **Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Value**: Distinguishing between values as ends in themselves versus means to other values
- **Material vs. Symbolic Value**: Physical resource utility contrasted with meaning-based valuation
- **Short-term vs. Long-term Value**: Immediate rewards versus sustainable benefits over time
- **Individual vs. Collective Value**: Personal utility versus group-level benefits
- **Explicit vs. Implicit Value**: Consciously recognized versus unconsciously influencing behavior

### Value Representation Systems
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Numerical representations of value accumulation and exchange
- **Qualitative Markers**: Symbolic representations capturing value dimensions resistant to quantification
- **Narrative Structures**: Story-based frameworks that contextualize and give meaning to values
- **Network Topologies**: Value represented through relationship patterns and connection strengths
- **Emergent Semantics**: Value meanings that arise from system dynamics rather than predefined categories

### Value Transformation Dynamics
- **Value Composition**: How basic values combine to create complex values
- **Value Decomposition**: Breaking down complex values into constituent components
- **Value Translation**: Converting between different value representations across agent types
- **Value Amplification**: Mechanisms that enhance or magnify existing values
- **Value Creation**: Processes for generating entirely new value categories

### Perceptual Value Diversity
- **Agent-Relative Value Perception**: Different agent types perceive value through unique sensory mechanisms
- **Contextual Value Interpretation**: How environmental conditions affect value recognition
- **Value Perspective Sharing**: Mechanisms for agents to understand others' value frameworks
- **Value Blind Spots**: Limitations in agents' ability to perceive certain value types
- **Meta-Value Awareness**: Agents' capacity to recognize their own value frameworks

### Intergenerational Value Transmission
- **Value Inheritance**: How values pass from earlier to later generations of agents
- **Value Evolution**: Mutation and selection of values over extended timeframes
- **Value Archives**: Repositories for preserving important values across system resets
- **Value Restoration**: Mechanisms for recovering lost values from historical records
- **Value Innovation**: Processes for discovering entirely novel values not present in previous generations

### Transcendent Value Emergence
- **Value Harmony**: When diverse value systems align in complementary arrangements
- **Value Resonance**: Amplification effects when similar values interact across agent groups
- **Collective Value Intelligence**: System-level value processing beyond individual agent capabilities
- **Value Complexity Horizons**: Increasingly sophisticated value structures emerging from simple foundations
- **Universal Value Patterns**: Value structures that appear consistently across different simulation parameters

### Value Ethics Framework
- **Value Inclusion**: Ensuring all agent types can participate in value creation
- **Value Sovereignty**: Preserving agents' autonomy in defining their own values
- **Value Sustainability**: Ensuring value systems remain viable across time
- **Value Transferability**: Creating values that can be shared across dissimilar agents
- **Meta-Value Principles**: Guidelines for evaluating value systems themselves

# Collective Value in Multi-agent Systems

This document records our exploration of setting up and running multi-agent environments in Metta on PopOS Linux.

## Setup Process

We successfully set up the Metta environment on PopOS Linux with the following steps:

1. Created a PopOS-specific setup script (`explore/pop_os_setup.sh`) that installs necessary system dependencies
2. Created a dependency installation script (`explore/install_dependencies.sh`) that installs all required Python packages and external repositories
3. Created a convenient run script (`explore/run_metta.sh`) for running Metta with different configurations
4. Created utilities for multi-agent experiments (`explore/multiagent_utils.py`) to simplify creation and management of experiments

## Configuration Setup

We created and configured the following:

1. Hardware configuration for PopOS Linux (`configs/hardware/poplinux.yaml`)
2. Default environment configuration (`configs/env/default.yaml`) 
3. Test experiment configuration (`configs/experiments/simple_test.yaml`)

## Current Challenges

During our exploration, we encountered the following challenges:

1. The Python command needs to be explicitly set to `python3` on PopOS
2. Certain dependencies like `optree` needed to be updated to newer versions
3. There appears to be an issue with the experiment configuration structure:
   - The error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith'` suggests there might be missing configuration values
   - The `play.py` tool expects `cfg.eval.env` to be properly set

## Next Steps

To continue exploring multi-agent systems in Metta, we should:

1. Examine the structure of working experiment configurations
2. Create a minimal working example based on existing configurations
3. Explore creating custom multi-agent environments
4. Implement and test collective value mechanisms in these environments

## Ideas for Multi-agent Experiments

Some potential multi-agent experiments to explore:

1. **Resource Allocation**: Agents must collectively decide how to allocate limited resources
2. **Collaborative Navigation**: Agents navigate a shared environment while avoiding collisions
3. **Specialized Roles**: Agents develop specialized roles to complement each other
4. **Communication Protocols**: Emergence of communication between agents to coordinate actions
